  <br><br><b>Panda jacket back</b>
  <br><br>This jacket was made for a recent trip to the Yunnan province of China which included a visit to the panda sanctuary near Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province.  The idea started with what was sold as a pillow panel showing a panda eating bamboo, its favorite food.  This became the center of the back.
