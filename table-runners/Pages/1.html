  <h1>Summer Veggies</h1>
  <p>Summer Veggies was inspired by fabrics found in the Keepsake Quilting catalog.  As I came up with a design I incorporated more veggies, of the same fabric line, which I found at quilt shows.  A different company later came out with a similar line but of a larger scale.  I was happy I found the smaller ones as they were much more suited to the scale of the project they inspired and were such fun that I made four place mats to go with the runner.  The yellow paths are for the sunshine every good vegetable garden needs.</p>
