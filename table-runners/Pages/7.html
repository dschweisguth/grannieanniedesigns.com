  <h1>Golden Stars in a Winter Sky</h1>
  <p>Golden Stars in a Winter Sky was inspired by a full sized quilt pattern in Quilt magazine.  The stars are made of many yellows and the blues in the background are all printed with stars.  A parallel project of different design was a quilt for granddaughter Amelia and used a similar idea of yellow stars on a blue background with pictures of her family.  Two more quilts are planned with these fabrics but I'm waiting for a yellow being hunted on the web.</p>
