            Summer Veggies
              <br/>Summer Veggies was inspired by fabrics found in the Keepsake Quilting catalog.  As I came up with a design I incorporated more veggies, of the same fabric line, which I found at quilt shows.  A different company later came out with a similar line but of a larger scale.  I was happy I found the smaller ones as they were much more suited to the scale of the project they inspired and were such fun that I made four place mats to go with the runner.  The yellow paths are for the sunshine every good vegetable garden needs.

            Autumn Leaves
              <br/>Autumn Leaves was made as a gift for an extended family Thanksgiving dinner. I like the border fabric so much I consider it one of my all time best finds.

            Cardinals
              <br/>The same year I made Cardinals for Christmas because the autumn leaves were so well received. Both can be used for a season rather than a day which makes them even more useful.

            Golden Stars in a Winter Sky
              <br/>Golden Stars in a Winter Sky was inspired by a full sized quilt pattern in Quilt magazine.  The stars are made of many yellows and the blues in the background are all printed with stars.  A parallel project of different design was a quilt for granddaughter Amelia and used a similar idea of yellow stars on a blue background with pictures of her family.  Two more quilts are planned with these fabrics but I'm waiting for a yellow being hunted on the web.

            By Request
              <br/>All the others were ideas I   
initiated. The color choice for this was the recipient's but the pattern choice was 
mine. The basic block is called Friendship Star because of the four pointed
star, but this is a variant because the corner blocks are made of two triangles  
rather than the basic square of fabric.

            Minnesota Hot Dish
              <br/>Having made several table runners to give away I decided it was time to make one for myself. This pattern is called Minnesota Hot Dish and I saw it many years ago at a quilt show in Minneapolis. I also made a full sized bed quilt from this pattern and realized again the importance of color placement. The quilt was done as an “easy” project while recovering from surgery. Since I was physically unable to shop I used what I had. That project served a need but is only “ok” as a finished project. The color placement in the runner is much better.
